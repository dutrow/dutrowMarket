eSales is planning an on-line auction site to allow sellers to 
auction items and buyers to place bids and ultimately purchase products. 
At the same time, eBidbot is planning an on-line automated bidding site 
that will help bidders make bids with eSales.

Sellers can start an auction using the eSales on-line auction site. 
They specify a title, category, description, asking price, start/stop time, 
and any images. Using the eSales buyer interface, buyers can manually
bid on auctions until they close.

With eBidbot, buyers also have the option of using an independent site 
to place their bids. Buyers place orders with eBidbot, providing them 
the auction and min/max bidding parameters. eBidbot will become a trusted 
client of eSales and be able to make bids on behalf of the actual buyer.

Both eSales and eBidbot have come to you to develop the initial phase of 
their applications. You are tasked with implementing a low-cost prototype,
based on current standards, to automate much of this activity. 
At this point in the project we are primarily looking to build the data 
access tiers for both the eSales and eBidbot (two separate systems). 
We will also add a minor amount of business logic to coordinate the 
data access between the individual data access objects.
